# DevelopersIn

This is a social media website built on the MERN stack (and uses Redux for global state management) supposed to be like LinkedIn but for Developers only. A developer can create a comprehensive profile, and upon adding his GitHub username, his latest 5 repos will be fetched and displayed using the GitHub API on his profile. He can post, like, comment others' posts, browse and connect with other developers. Chatting functionality coming soon!


Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, React.js, Redux
